## About

A lightweight Ruby library for interacting with multiple LLM providers

## Examples

### Providers

#### Introduction

All providers inherit from [`LLM::Provider`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm/LLM/Provider.html).
They share a common interface and set of functionality between them. They can be
instantiated with an API key and an (optional) set of options via the
[the singleton methods of LLM](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm/LLM.html).
For example:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"
llm = LLM.openai("yourapikey", <options>)
llm = LLM.anthropic("yourapikey", <options>)
llm = LLM.ollama(nil, <options>)
# etc ...
```

### Completion API

#### LazyConversation

The
[`LLM::Provider#chat`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm/LLM/Provider.html#chat-instance_method)
method returns a
[`LLM::LazyConversation`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm/LLM/LazyConversation.html)
object
that can maintain a "lazy" conversation where input prompts are sent to the
provider only when needed. Once a conversation is initiated it will maintain a
thread of messages that provide the LLM with a certain amount of extra context
that can be re-used within the conversation:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai("yourapikey")
bot = llm.chat "keep the answer concise", :system
bot.chat URI("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Red_eyed_tree_frog_edit2.jpg")
bot.chat "What is the frog's name?"
bot.chat "What is the frog's habitat?"
bot.chat "What is the frog's diet?"

##
# At this point a single request is made to the provider
# See 'LLM::MessageQueue' for more details
bot.messages.each do |message|
  print "[#{message.role}] ", message.content, "\n"
end

##
# [system] keep the answer concise
# [user] [{:type=>:image_url, :image_url=>{:url=>"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Red_eyed_tree_frog_edit2.jpg"}}]
# [user] What is the frog's name?
# [user] What is the frog's habitat?
# [user] What is the frog's diet?
# [assistant] The frog in the image is likely a Red-eyed Tree Frog.
#
#  #### Habitat:
#  - Typically found in tropical rainforests, especially in Central America.
#
#  #### Diet:
#   - Primarily insectivorous, feeding on insects like crickets and moths.
```

#### Conversation

The
[`LLM::Provider#chat`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm/LLM/Provider.html#chat!-instance_method)
method returns a
[`LLM::Conversation`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm/LLM/Conversation.html)
object that can maintain a conversation with a LLM provider but unlike
[`LLM::LazyConversation`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm/LLM/LazyConversation.html)
each call to `chat!` / `chat` corresponds to a HTTP request to the provider:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai("yourapikey")
bot = llm.chat! "be a helpful assistant", :system
bot.chat "keep the answers short and sweet", :system
bot.chat "help me choose a good book"
bot.chat "books of poetry"
bot.messages.each do |message|
  print "[#{message.role}] ", message.content, "\n"
end

##
# [system] be a helpful assistant
# [assistant] Of course! How can I assist you today?
# [system] keep the answers short and sweet
# [assistant] Got it! What do you need help with?
# [user] help me choose a good book
# [assistant] Sure! What genre are you interested in?
# [user] books of poetry
# [assistant] Here are a few great poetry collections:
#
# 1. **"The Sun and Her Flowers" by Rupi Kaur**
# 2. **"The Carrying" by Ada Limón**
# 3. **"Milk and Honey" by Rupi Kaur**
# 4. **"Ariel" by Sylvia Plath**
# 5. **"The Poetry of Pablo Neruda"**
#
# Happy reading!
```
